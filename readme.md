## Game Description

This is a text-based game called "Sonar".
It is a one-person turn-based game that requires the player to find the hidden treasures given a 2D grid.
First, the player is required to input the size of a 2D grid as the map of the game.
And then the player needs to input the number of the treasures crates and sonars which are used to "detect" the crates on the map.

Every turn, the player place a sonar by designating the x-y coordinates on the map. If there is a treasure crate nearby,
a number,which represent the distance between the crates and the sonar, will show up on the sonar. Below is an example. 


e.g.


C ~ ~ ~ ~

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

~ ~ 2 ~ ~

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Suppose 'C' represents where the hidden treasure is at, '~' represents the unrevealed grids of the map, 
and '2' is where the player put her sonar. The '2' indicates that the treasure crate, 'C', is two cells away.


Repeat the process until either all the treasure are found or the sonars run out.
